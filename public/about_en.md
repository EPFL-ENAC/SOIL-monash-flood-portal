### Rationale

Floods are one of the most common natural disasters globally, mainly caused by atmospheric conditions that lead to heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt, or storm surge. When the surface runoff exceeds the capacity of the drainage network and surface water cannot enter the sewerage system, the drainage network overflows, resulting in overland flow, which marks the start of flooding. In general, floods can develop over hours to days. The group at highest risk of flooding comprises those who live in flood-prone areas, in non-resilient buildings, lack of access to warning systems and awareness of the potential hazards of flooding. Over time, floods have become more frequent and severe, primarily caused by the increase in the occurrence and intensity of extreme rainfall events attributed to climate change.

In Malaysia, floods are the most prevalent form of disaster. This is mainly contributed by the rapid economic development where structural development and environmental deterioration are uncontrolled. Besides, Malaysia experiences substantial rainfall throughout the year, particularly during the monsoon season, with annual rainfall ranging from 2500-3000mm per year. In conjunction with extreme rainfall events, this has led to a rise in flash floods. Flash floods have impacted the city centre by causing heavy traffic congestion and hindering mobility, which disrupts daily activities within the city.

As the frequency of flood disasters occurring in Malaysia continues to rise over the years, flood warning plays an important role in mitigating the negative impacts of flooding. The Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia (DID) has established the National Flood Forecasting and Warning Programme to provide public flood forecasting and warning services. The main objective of this program is to develop the National Flood Forecasting and Warning System (NaFFWS) that will assist DID in mitigating future floods. Most informed decisions on flood mitigation require abundant data, information and modelling efforts, which can be time-consuming and resource intensive. However, implementing an interactive decision support system can assist the users in settling on compelling decisions in flood disaster mitigation and prevention.
