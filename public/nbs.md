## Natural-based Solutions

### Suitability Assessment Criteria

These criteria are used to select the suitable locations for each NbS, based on the EU NWRM Manual. Some NbS may have similar criteria as another, hence some NbS may have similar suitable locations, hence, they overlay each other. The preferred NbS will be evaluated based on the results of the hydraulic model. Additionally, for each NbS, the suitability map is intersected with the 20,50 and 100-year ARI flood extent so that the NbS are implemented in flood prone areas and are designed for the largest flood extent. 
 
#### Afforestation

* Slope >= 30%
  * Ideal up to steeper slopes, as it provides benefits in sediment retention and prevention of erosion
* Free and open space (forests, agricultural, bare land, recreation, and undeveloped land)
  * These areas allow for land use changes as compared to built areas.
* Distance from roads >= 50 m
  * Allows for buffer from roads to avoid disturbances/disruptions, ex. pollution

#### Floodplain restorations

* Slope >= 5%:
  * Shallow slopes reduce discharge peaks and prolong retention periods, while steeper slopes worsen the effects of retention, especially when the flood wave is totally discharged in the channel
* Free and open space (forests, agricultural, bare land, recreation, and undeveloped land)
  * These areas allow for land use changes as compared to built areas.
* Low soil erosion
  * Avoids the erosion of the floodplains
* Distance from roads >= 50 m
  * Allows for buffer from roads to avoid disturbances/disruptions, ex. pollution

#### Green spaces and parks

* Within urban areas
  * By definition, the parks are to be located within urban areas
* Free and open space (forests, agricultural, bare land, recreation, and undeveloped land)
  * These areas allow for land use changes as compared to built areas.

#### Wetlands

* Slope >= 5%
  * Wetlands naturally occur either in flat areas or in topographic depressions
* Free and open space (forests, agricultural, bare land, recreation, and undeveloped land)
  * These areas allow for land use changes as compared to built areas.
* Low permeability soil
  * Wetlands are more effective in low permeable soils to allow for water retention, erosion control, and improve water quality
* Distance from roads >= 50 m
  * Allows for buffer from roads to avoid disturbances/disruptions, ex. pollution

#### Infiltration basin

* Slope >= 5%
  * They should be made as level as possible to maximise storage and infiltration potential and minimise the risk of erosion
* Free and open space (forests, agricultural, bare land, recreation, and undeveloped land)
  * These areas allow for land use changes as compared to built areas.
* Low soil erosion:
  * Basins should not be sited on unstable ground to ensure structural integrity
* Distance from brownfields, tin mining ponds, infrastructure and utilities, and industry
  * Due to the risk of leaching contaminants into underlying groundwater
* High permeability soils:
  * To allow for infiltration of water
* Areas with low groundwater potential
  * Avoid leaching of contaminants into water source
* Distance from roads >= 50 m
  * Allows for a buffer from roads to avoid disturbances/disruptions.

### Manning’s n 

The type of land cover that is prominent in Malaysia is classified based on the US National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). These values are selected a guide that assigns Manning’s n to each land cover in that classification system based on the HEC-RAS 2D Manual. 

* Afforestation:
  * Land Cover: Evergreen Forest (LC = 42)
  * n = 0.15
* Wetlands:
  * Land Cover: Wooded Wetlands (LC = 90)
  * n = 0.08
* Floodplain restoration
  * n = 0.15
  * This NbS involves restoring floodplains to its original conditions (evergreen)
* Green spaces and parks
  * Land Cover: Developed, open space (LC = 21)
  * n = 0.035
* Infiltration basin
  * Type of channel: Excavated or dredged channels, earth, straight, and uniform, gravel uniform section, clean with short grass, few weeds
  * n = 0.027
