## Vulnerability

The vulnerability mapping is done by first developing the flood vulnerability index (FVI). In this research, the composite index was chosen as the suitable indicator-based method to perform this task. Based on the research done by Jha and Gundimeda (2019), the composite index method can better represent an area's vulnerability level. Furthermore, it also helps simplify complex technical data for ease of interpretation.

Classification of vulnerability maps:

| Index value      | Description                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Less than 0.10   | Very low vulnerability to floods  |
| 0.10 to 0.25     | Low vulnerability to floods       |
| 0.25 to 0.50     | Vulnerable to floods              |
| 0.50 to 0.75     | High vulnerability to floods      |
| 0.75 to 1        | Very high vulnerability to floods |
